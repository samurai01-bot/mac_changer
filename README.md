# mac_changer
Quickly and conveniently change MAC address using just one command in the Linux terminal!


To work, you will need to install a couple of libraries in Python.

1. pip install subprocess
2. pip install optparse
3. pip install re

After installing the libraries, you need to download the file, move it to a folder convenient for you, and run this command in the terminal:

1. python mac-changer2.py --help

After you write --help, you will see instructions for using the script.
